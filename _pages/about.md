My name is Xinyang Zhou. I am a final-year undergraduate student at the [Data Intelligence Group](https://diggers.ai/), [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), Everest program (National top-talented program in UESTC), supervised by [Prof. Wen Li](https://wenli-vision.github.io/) and [Prof. Lixin Duan](http://lxduan.info/). I am also a research assistant at the National University of Singapore(NUS), under the supervision of [Prof. Angela Yao](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ayao/).

My research currently focuses on Physical AI and Multimodal Learning, including Physically consistent Video Generation, Video Understanding, etc. My research will focus on learning physical world
models and model–environment interaction within generative frameworks. I do believe that progress
in physically grounded world modeling is a promising path toward Artificial General Intelligence.
